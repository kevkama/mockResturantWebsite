                        compilation of lively dining experiences, top-notch service and quality American Italian cuisine
                        that

                        Colletta’s cuisine puts a twist on treasured classics and introducing modern culinary techniques
                        with
                        the changing of the seasons. House-made pastas, cheeses and other hand-crafted ingredients abound in
                        the
                        from-scratch kitchen, and guests will taste the culinary team’s attention to detail in every bite.
